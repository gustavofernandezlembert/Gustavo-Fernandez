# Network Monitor

## Overview

The Network Monitor project is a comprehensive dashboard and a suite of real-time engineering and networking tools developed to collect, analyze, and report on the state and performance of thousands of embedded Linux radio base stations
and customer devices. This project utilizes Tableau for visualizing the data, providing insights into network throughput, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), device connectivity, and more.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Collects real-time data from embedded Linux radio base stations and customer devices.
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyzes network performance metrics such as throughput, SNR, RSSI, and noise levels.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Uses Tableau to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing network performance metrics.
- **Device Connectivity Monitoring**: Monitors the connectivity status of devices across different networks and projects.
- **Association List and Route Metrics**: Provides detailed information on device associations and route metrics.
