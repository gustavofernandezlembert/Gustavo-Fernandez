# [Project 0: A comparison of statistical methods for modeling count data with an application to hospital length of stay]([https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Logistic-Regression-Heart-Data-/blob/master/Heart.pdf](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01685-8))

*In this study, we compared the performance of the Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models using simulated and empirical data. 


# [Project 1: Logistic Regression Heart Dataset](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Logistic-Regression-Heart-Data-/blob/master/Heart.pdf)

* Built a logistic regression model to capture the risk of having a heart disease. 

# [Project 2: Medicare Hospital Charges for DRG-689: Association with Hospital Metropolitan Status ](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Medicare-Hospital-Charges-)

* Study objective: To determine the association of New York hospitals metropolitan status with the mean hospital charges for Medicare diagnosis(DRG-689). 

# [Project 3: Maximum Likelihood Normal Distribution](https://gustavofernandezlembert.github.io/Maximum-Likelihood/)

* A simple explanation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation of the Normal distribution in R.

# [Project 4: Analysis of Router Setup Data](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Analysis-Router-Setup)

* The purpose of the analysis is to show how to pull signal from the noise when dealing with a messy dataset.

# [Project 5: SQL Assessment](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Example_of_SQL_Querys)

* Several database squemas are provided followed by an assesment then several SQL queries are presented as solutions.
