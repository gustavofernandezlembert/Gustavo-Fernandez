# [Project 1: Logistic Regression - Heart Data](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Logistic-Regression-Heart-Data-/blob/master/Heart.pdf)

* Developed a logistic regression model to capture the risk of having a heart disease. 

* Stepwise model selection method was used to find the optimal model. 

# [Project 2: Analysis LOS Diabetic Patient Records](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Analysis-Diabetic-Patients-Records-/blob/master/Analysis%20of%20length%20of%20Stay%20Diabetic.pdf)

* Statistical Methods Comparison for the analysis of Length of Hospital Stay (LOS) of 70,000 Diabetic Patient Record.

* Prediction Ability vs Inference wich method perform better.

* OLS Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Poisson Regression methods were employed.

# [Project 3: Maximum Likelihood - Normal Distribution](https://gustavofernandezlembert.github.io/Maximum-Likelihood/)

* A simple explanation of the Maximum Likelihood of the normal distribution in R.
