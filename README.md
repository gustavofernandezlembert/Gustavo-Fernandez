# About me

I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master of Science degree in Applied Statistics and Data Science. My expertise lies in the realm of wireless communications, specifically in RF/RAN, and I possess a profound fascination for the realm of Data Analytics. My ultimate goal is to foster a seamless connection between technology and valuable insights, thereby bridging the gap between the two domains.

My curiosity and drive to uncover meaningful insights led me to explore the world of Data Science. I have become proficient in leveraging tools such as SQL, Excel, R, Python, and SAS to extract valuable information from complex datasets. Data Analytics has become a powerful lens through which I can see beyond the numbers, uncover patterns, and provide actionable recommendations. I am also adept at visualizing data using tools like Tableau and Power BI, enabling effective communication of insights to a diverse audience.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find great joy in taking leausure walks, going to the gym, playing softball and staying updated with the latest advancements in wireless technology and the world of data. I am an avid reader, always seeking inspiration from thought leaders in the field. Exploring new technologies, attending industry conferences, and engaging in discussions with fellow professionals are some of the ways I fuel my passion for continuous learning.

Join me on this journey as I blend my expertise in wireless communications and Data Science to make a positive impact.

Thank you for visiting my About Me page. I look forward to connecting and sharing insights with like-minded individuals.

# [Project 1: A comparison of statistical methods for modeling count data with an application to hospital length of stay](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01685-8)

* In this study, we compared the performance of the Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models using simulated and empirical data.

# [Project 2: Logistic Regression Heart Dataset](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Logistic-Regression-Heart-Data-/blob/master/Heart.pdf)

* Developed a logistic regression model to assess the likelihood of experiencing heart disease.

# [Project 3: Waze Churn Project](Waze project lab.ipynb)

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

* Who are the users most likely to churn?

* Why do users churn? 

* When do users churn? 

Waze’s data team is in the earliest stages of the churn project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

* Build a dataframe for the churn dataset

* Examine data type of each column

* Gather descriptive statistics 
  
# [Project 4: SQL Assessment](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Example_of_SQL_Querys)

* The document includes multiple database schemas, followed by an evaluation, and presents a set of SQL queries as solutions.

# [Project 5: Analysis of Router Setup Data](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Analysis-Router-Setup)

* The objective of the analysis is to demonstrate effective techniques for extracting meaningful patterns from a complex and noisy dataset.

# [Project 6: Maximum Likelihood Normal Distribution](https://gustavofernandezlembert.github.io/Maximum-Likelihood/)

* A concise overview of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) applied to the Normal distribution using R.

# [Project 7: Medicare Hospital Charges for DRG-689: Association with Hospital Metropolitan Status ](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Medicare-Hospital-Charges-)

* Study objective: To determine the association of New York hospitals metropolitan status with the mean hospital charges for Medicare diagnosis(DRG-689).
