# About me

I'm Gustavo Fernandez, a passionate professional in the field of telecommunications and data science. With a strong background in wireless communications (RF/RAN) and a keen interest in data analytics, I strive to bridge the gap between technology and insights.

In my professional journey as a Telecom Engineer, I have gained extensive experience in RF/RAN network optimization, design, rollout, KPI, and quality assurance. I have delved into the intricacies of 5G NR and LTE technologies, honing my skills in telecom infrastructure network principles, coverage and capacity requirements, and RF planning, design, and optimization. 

My curiosity and drive to uncover meaningful insights led me to explore the world of data science. I have become proficient in leveraging tools such as SQL, Excel, R, Python, and SAS to extract valuable information from complex datasets. Data analytics has become a powerful lens through which I can see beyond the numbers, uncover patterns, and provide actionable recommendations. I am also adept at visualizing data using tools like Tableau and Power BI, enabling effective communication of insights to a diverse audience.

Embarking on courses in data science, I aspire to expand my knowledge and skills further. I am eager to deepen my understanding of advanced statistical analysis techniques and explore cutting-edge methodologies in machine learning and predictive modeling. By immersing myself in these courses, I aim to broaden my perspective, enhance my problem-solving abilities, and unlock new opportunities for growth and innovation.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find great joy in taking leausure walks, playign softball and staying updated with the latest advancements in technology and the world of data. I am an avid reader, always seeking inspiration from thought leaders in the field. Exploring new technologies, attending industry conferences, and engaging in discussions with fellow professionals are some of the ways I fuel my passion for continuous learning.

Join me on this journey as I blend my expertise in wireless communications and data science to make a positive impact.

Thank you for visiting my About Me page. I look forward to connecting and sharing insights with like-minded individuals.
