# About me

Experienced Telecom Engineer with a specialization in wireless communications (RF/RAN) with a strong focus on 5G RF/ RAN network optimization, design, rollout, KPI, and quality assurance. With over 10 years of professional experience, I am well-versed in 3GPP standards, RAN architecture, signaling, and 
operation. Additionally, I possess Data Science and Analytics skills, enabling me to extract valuable insights from telecom data. I deliver data-driven solutions, actionable insights, and recommendations to optimize network performance and operational efficiency.

RF tools: Atoll, QGIS, Wavescape, IBMS, Xcal, Xcap.
Data Science & Analytics tools: SQL, R, Python, SAS, Tableau, Power BI.
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, ElementTree, TensorFlow.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I find great joy in taking leisure walks, going to the gym, playing softball, exploring cities, and staying updated with the latest advancements in wireless technology and the world of data science. I am an avid reader, always seeking inspiration from thought leaders in the field. Exploring new technologies, attending industry conferences, and engaging in discussions with fellow professionals are some of the ways I fuel my passion for continuous learning.

Thank you for visiting my About Me page. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals.

# [Project 1: EarthMark: Transforming Google Earth Placemarks into HTML Tables](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Placemarks.KML_TO_HTML)

* This project aims to simplify the process of converting KML files containing Google Earth placemarks into HTML tables.
  
* It eliminates the need for manually copying the placemark coordinates and pasting them into other documents one by one. The proposed workflow involves organizing all placemarks of your project within a folder in Google Earth, exporting the folder as a .kml file, and uploading it to the app. The app will generate a table displaying each placemark's name and their corresponding lat and long coordinates. 
                                                                      
* This tool is ideal for professionals who frequently use Google Earth and need to extract and organize multiple placemarks' names and coordinate information into a table format. It simplifies the process, allowing easy copying into other documents like PPT, Word, and spreadsheets.

* The script has been developed into a web app and can be accessed through the following link:

# [Project 2: A comparison of statistical methods for modeling count data with an application to hospital length of stay](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-022-01685-8)

* In this study, we compared the performance of the Poisson, negative binomial (NB), zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models using simulated and empirical data.

# [Project 3: Logistic Regression Heart Dataset](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Logistic-Regression-Heart-Data-/blob/master/Heart.pdf)

* Developed a logistic regression model to assess the likelihood of experiencing heart disease.

# [Project 4: Waze Churn Project](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Gustavo-Fernandez/blob/1cd91b161aed7a225d510c0215afaeec90734e3e/%20Waze%20project%20lab.ipynb)

The Waze data team is developing a data analytics project aimed at increasing overall growth by preventing monthly user churn on the Waze app. For the purposes of this project, churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. 

This report offers a preliminary data summary, information on the project status, and key insights of Milestone 2, which impact the future development of the overall project.  

Milestone 2 Objectives:

* Inspect user data to learn important relationships between variables. 

Methods: 
* Built a data frame where Each row represents a single observation, and each column represents a single variable
* Collected preliminary statistics
* Analyzed user behavior
  
# [Project 5: SQL Assessment](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Example_of_SQL_Querys)

* The document includes multiple database schemas, followed by an evaluation, and presents a set of SQL queries as solutions.

# [Project 6: Analysis of Router Setup Data](https://github.com/gustavofernandezlembert/Analysis-Router-Setup)

* The analysis aims to demonstrate effective techniques for extracting meaningful patterns from a complex and noisy dataset.

# [Project 7: Maximum Likelihood Normal Distribution](https://gustavofernandezlembert.github.io/Maximum-Likelihood/)

* A simple overview of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) applied to the Normal distribution using R.
